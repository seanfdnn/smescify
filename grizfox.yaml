Situation: 41 Signal Regiment may be tasked to support domestic operations IAW COP WILD ROSE, which requires the capability to deploy communications to the Territorial Battle Group (TBG) HQ and down to Domestic Response Company (DRC) CPs, up to 150 km apart. 41 Signal Regiment possesses a variety of systems and bearers, including HF, FoxNet and LCSS(U) over both satellite and LTE, that have yet to be exercised as a strong, reliable capability.

Mission: 41 Signal Regiment will exercise beyond line-of-site communications at between home-garrisons of EDMONTON, RED DEER and CALGARY on 28 April 2018 IOT prepare Signallers and equipment for domestic operations

Execution:

  Concept of Operations :
    Commander's Intent :
      I intend to develop and demonstrate the capability of the Regt to reliably establish beyond-line of site communications over HF, LTE and satellite. I intend for distributed, intra-Regt Signals training to become the norm moving forward. To accomplish this, I intend for Squadrons to create semi-static in-garrison training environments that can be linked to simulate a domestic op scenario. These in-garrison training environments should be mirrored between the cities and be representative of the equipment and layout of the TBG HQ and DRC CPs.  I intended to demonstrate this capability on a one-day, in-garrison exercise on 28 April 2018.
